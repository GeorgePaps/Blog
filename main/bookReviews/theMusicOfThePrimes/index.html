            <h1>The Music of the Primes -  Marcus du Sautoy</h1>

            Quite enjoyable book.  <br>
            <p>
            Follows the journey of mathematicians to uncover the secrets of prime numbers. <br>
            I enjoyed a lot the glimpses in the life of many great mathematicians 
            (Riemman, Ramanujan, Hilbert, Hardy, Euler, Cauchy, and others). 
            Marcus du Sautoy strikes a pleasant balance between providing information about the technical progress each mathematician made 
            and the context of each mathematician's era and surroundings.
            As a result after finishing the book you end up having an enhanced intuition 
            about the interaction of society, mathematical research, and politics.
            Which personally is the most important takeaway from this book.
