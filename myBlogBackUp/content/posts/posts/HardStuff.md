The mechanical engineering diploma 
and the TU Delft MSc at times required a lot of effort.
The task of completing some projects in time 
and well enough seemed at moments insurmountable.
This may have been the outcome of some bad semester planning,
of project complexity, or of any other reason.
In this post won't focus on how I got
in this "bottleneck" phase 
\- which happened quite many times \-,
I would instead like to discuss how it felt.

At first, let's start by discussing what I consider "bottleneck" phase.
To put it simply, 
it is the period that starts 
the moment you realize 
that completing the task at hand 
in the desired level within the allocated time,
seems impossible.
Usually this happens in the last stages of a task.
