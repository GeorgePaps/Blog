I recently finished Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee,
a long but rather delightful read.
In this book the author follows humanity's journey 
towards unravelling the mysteries of genetics. 

Among the many fascinating topics explored in the book,
one that captured my imagination
is that of Mitochondrial Eve.
This exotically named concept is based on two simple propositions.
The first is that all modern humans 
can trace their lineage back to a single female ancestor[^1].
The second is 
that each human inherits their mitochondrial DNA from their mother side.
Combining these two propositions 
we arrive to the conclusion that all modern humans 
can trace their mitochondrial DNA to a single woman.
That woman is called Mitochondrial Eve.

The reason the concept of Mitochondrial Eve 
struck a special chord within me 
is its tangibility.
The concept of a common female ancestor for all humanity
should be intuitive to most.
However, it is rather theoretical and vague,
with the implied lineage lost in time. 
Adding the aspect of mitochondrial DNA -something "tangible"-
being passed "intact" from mother to mother
gives a visceral feeling to it;
it makes it feel real.
Of course, one can argue that, as humanity,
we have other parts of DNA in common with that ancestor. 
That does not feel the same though,
as most other parts of DNA are inherited from both our parents
and are diluted from generation to generation.

So in brief, 
that was a concept from the book that intrigued me.
Still,
after reflecting on it for some time, 
the idea that a piece of DNA
has passed "intact" from mother to mother,
connecting all of humanity,
strikes a special primal chord within me. 

Once I go through the book notes again,
I might come back with more thoughts 
on the topic of genes.
