A phrase I 've been pondering on for some time now is "walk your walk".
I found that keeping this phrase handy is useful for my mentality.
In this post I will share my two main interpretations of it. 

The first interpretation relates to personal goal setting. 
The phrase works as a reminder to keep going,
to walk the path that you intended to 
and not give up when you encounter the first obstacle. 
It reminds me that often, what makes a path valuable,
are the obstacles you encounter along the way.
Dealing with obstacles can help you grow as a person 
and build confidence. 
Of course there will be times that it is better to 
reevaluate the direction in which you are heading to,
but this should be a gradual process
not a reaction to some unexpected obstacle[^1].

The second interpretation of "walk your walk" relates to external events.
In life, to a great extend,
you cannot control the things that will happen to you.[^2]
In many cases, events might not unfold as hoped.[^3]
In cases like that,
this phrase serves as a reminder to not complaint,
accept the event, adapt, and act accordingly.
The best plan is the plan that adapts to reality.

[^1]: Ideally you should establish some reflection habits (maybe monthly) for evaluating changes in life trajectory.
[^2]: You can of course better position yourself in life so to reduce the probability of some negative events
      and increase the probability of some positive; still though, you don't control external events.
[^3]: I am talking mostly about everyday life disappointments and not major negative life events.
