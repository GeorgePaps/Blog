Rating 6/10.

I looked forward to the publication of this book for months.
I've been following Shane's work in Farnam Street for quite some time now
and over time it has influenced my thinking to a considehugrable extent.
Unfortunately, I found the book worse than expected.

In my mind there are three main problems:
- The book structure is somewhat unintuitive. 
While reading the book I had a nagging feeling that the flow of narrative didn't much the structure of the book.
That was a big problem as it hindered my information absorption process. 
- Not very actionable. 
I felt that many calls to action were more complicated than necessary.
- Finally, compared with other similar books the flow of the text was not great. Reading each chapter wasn't a seamless experience that made you want to continue to the next. Not sure where to attribute that though. I guess that's the art of writing and editing.

That being said it can still be a useful book too read but I feel it expects too much personal work from the reader.
