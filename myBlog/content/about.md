Hello and welcome to my personal blog.

My name is Georgios Papazotos and I currently live in Athens, Greece.
<!-- I write mostly about programming, music, and life. -->

I have a background in mechanical engineering (diploma - AUTH) and engineering and policy analysis (MSc - TU Delft). 
This period I am focusing on developing my programming and computer science skills.
For the last three years I've been working at EY Greece on a variety of projects, mostly as a python developer and as a data engineer/analyst. 
In my free time, aside from socializing,
I enjoy reading, playing chess, playing music, running, 
and writing amongst other things.
I am spending some time also doing stock research, I am trying to minimize/automate that though.
