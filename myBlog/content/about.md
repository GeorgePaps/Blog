Hello and welcome to my personal blog.

I live in Athens, Greece.
I have a background in mechanical engineering (diploma - AUTH) and engineering and policy analysis (MSc - TU Delft). 
For the last 4 years I've been working at EY Greece on a variety of projects, mostly as a python developer and as a data engineer. 
Currently I am also focusing on developing my machine learning and computer vision skills in particular.


In my free time
I enjoy reading, playing music, running, 
and writing amongst other things.
