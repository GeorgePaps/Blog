Hello and welcome to my personal blog.

My name is Georgios Papazotos and I live in Athens, Greece.
I write mostly about programming and life.

I have a background in mechanical engineering (diploma) and engineering and policy analysis (MSc). 
Î¤he past years I am focusing on developing my programming and computer science skills.

The last two years I've been working at EY Greece on a variety of projects   
mostly as a python developer and as a data engineer/analyst. 
In my free time, aside from socializing,
I enjoy reading, playing music, and writing amongst other things.
