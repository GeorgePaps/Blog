Rating 6/10

Clear thinking by Shane Parrish is a book I looked forward to reading for quite some time.
I've been following Shane's work in Farnam Street for quite some time now
and over time it has influenced my thinking to an important extent.
Unfortunately, I found the book worse than expected.

In my mind there are three main problems:
- The book structure is somewhat unintuitive. While reading the book I had an almost constant nagging feeling that the flow of narrative didn't much the structure of the book.
- Not very actionable. I felt that many calls to action 
- Not great flow in the chapters. Do not know where to address that. 

That being said it can still be a useful book too read but expects in my opinion too much personal work from the reader.
