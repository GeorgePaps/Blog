A phrase I 've been pondering on for some time now is "walk your walk".
I found that keeping this phrase handy is useful for my mentality
and in this essay I will share my two interpretations of it. 

The first interpretation relates to personal goal setting. 
The phrase works as a reminder to keep going,
to walk the path that you intended to 
and not give up when you encounter the first obstacle. 
It reminds me that often, what makes a path valuable
is the obstacles you encounter along the way.
Dealing with obstacles can help you grow as a person 
and build confidence. 
Of course there will be times that is better to reconsider and
reevaluate the direction in which you are heading to,
but it should be a gradual process
not a reaction to some unexpected obstacle.

The second interpretation of "walk your walk" relates to external events.
In life, to a great extend,
you cannot control the things that will happen to you.[^1]
In many cases events might not unfold as hoped.[^2]
In cases like that,
this phrase serves as a reminder to not complaint,
accept the event, adapt, and act accordingly.
The best plan is the plan that adapts to reality.

[^1]: You can of course better position yourself in life so to reduce the probability of some negative events and increase the probability of some positive. Still though, you won't control external events.
[^2]: I am talking mostly about everyday life disappointments and not major negative life events.
