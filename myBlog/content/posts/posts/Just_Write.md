Find a system that makes writing and re-writing effortless. 
You don't have to post everything you write,
but it's good to write consistently.

Why do that in the first place though?
Because writing is an effective way of thinking.
When writing you embark on a mental journey towards unexplored paths.
A journey where you both explore and expand your thoughts. 
And this is an invaluable process hardly accessible by other means.  

<!-- As for my system, 
currently I just use a terminal with micro editor. 
Its simple GUI offers minimal distractions
and is available within a few key strokes.     -->
