I've pledged to read 20 books in 2025.
Let's see how that goes.
This is the list of the books I've read thus far.
I have highlighted my favorite ones.
My favorite till now is Sapiens, an amazing book. 
Totally recommend it.

- **"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"** by Yuval Noah Harari - 10/10

- Police by *Jo Nesbo* - 6/10
