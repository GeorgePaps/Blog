To keep up with my reading habit,
I pledged to read 20 books in 2025.
Here follows the list of books I've read thus far,
the ones with bold are my favorites.
Hope you'll find some interesting book ideas.

- **"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"** by Yuval Noah Harari - 10/10

- Police by *Jo Nesbo* - 6/10
