In this book the author attempts to formally approach consciousness and to unravel the mysteries of its emergence. An arguably ambitious goal. Surprisingly, what you come to realize throughout the book, is that to some extend he succeeds. His concept of convoluted, multi-level strange loops seems to offer an interesting leeway towards the origins of consciousness.

<p>Rating: 6/10</p>
<p>In this book the author attempts to formally approach consciousness and to unravel the mysteries of its emergence.
An arguably ambitious goal.
Surprisingly,
what you come to realize throughout the book,
is that to some extend
he succeeds.
His concept of convoluted,
multi-level strange loops seems to
offer an interesting leeway towards the origins of consciousness.
Maybe not the only available,
nor the most effective,
but nevertheless a viable one.</p>
<p>On the downsides,
this book feels quite long
and more complicated than necessary.
Additionally, the multiple lenses (music-Bach, paintings-Escher, logic-Gödel)
he uses to approach the main topic
are interesting, but at times too much.
Finally, the dialogues also feel rather unnecessary.</p>
<p>Considering that these downsides make the book quite tough to read at times,
I am not sure whether I would recommend to most people.
Maybe to those interested in the theoretical underpinnings and the history
of the field of artificial intelligence and computer science in general.</p>
<p>Overall it feels like a strong mind is pushing towards a slightly wrong direction.
You cannot tell where exactly the right one is,
but you get a nagging feeling throughout the book that something is off.
Nevertheless there are gains towards the right direction.
But like a force applied to a direction other than the one an object moves,
only a fraction of it is utilized.</p>
