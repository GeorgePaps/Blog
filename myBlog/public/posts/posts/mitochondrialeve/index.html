In this book the author follows humanity’s journey towards unravelling the mysteries of genetics.\nAmong the many fascinating topics explored in the book, one that captured my imagination is that of Mitochondrial Eve. This exotically named concept is based on two simple propositions. The first is that all modern humans can trace their lineage back to a single female ancestor1. The second is that each human inherits their mitochondrial DNA from their mother side. Combining these two propositions we arrive to the conclusion that all modern humans can trace their mitochondrial DNA to a single woman. That woman is called Mitochondrial Eve.\nThe reason the concept of Mitochondrial Eve struck a special chord within me is its tangibility. The concept of a common female ancestor for all humanity should be intuitive to most. However, it is rather theoretical and vague, with the implied lineage lost in time. Adding the aspect of mitochondrial DNA -something “tangible”- being passed “intact” from mother to mother gives a visceral feeling to it; it makes it feel real. Of course, one can argue that, as humanity, we have other parts of DNA in common with that ancestor. That does not feel the same though, as most other parts of DNA are inherited from both our parents and are diluted from generation to generation.\nSo in brief, that was a concept from the book that intrigued me. Still, after reflecting on it for some time, the idea that a piece of DNA has passed “intact” from mother to mother, connecting all of humanity, strikes a special primal chord within me.\nOnce I go through the book notes again, I might come back with more thoughts on the topic of genes.\nMatrilinear most recent common ancestor (MRCA). It refers to woman estimated to have lived in Africa around two hundred years ago. ↩︎\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>I recently finished Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee,
a long but rather delightful read.
In this book the author follows humanity&rsquo;s journey
towards unravelling the mysteries of genetics.</p>
<p>Among the many fascinating topics explored in the book,
one that captured my imagination
is that of Mitochondrial Eve.
This exotically named concept is based on two simple propositions.
The first is that all modern humans
can trace their lineage back to a single female ancestor<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
The second is
that each human inherits their mitochondrial DNA from their mother side.
Combining these two propositions
we arrive to the conclusion that all modern humans
can trace their mitochondrial DNA to a single woman.
That woman is called Mitochondrial Eve.</p>
<p>The reason the concept of Mitochondrial Eve
struck a special chord within me
is its tangibility.
The concept of a common female ancestor for all humanity
should be intuitive to most.
However, it is rather theoretical and vague,
with the implied lineage lost in time.
Adding the aspect of mitochondrial DNA -something &ldquo;tangible&rdquo;-
being passed &ldquo;intact&rdquo; from mother to mother
gives a visceral feeling to it;
it makes it feel real.
Of course, one can argue that, as humanity,
we have other parts of DNA in common with that ancestor.
That does not feel the same though,
as most other parts of DNA are inherited from both our parents
and are diluted from generation to generation.</p>
<p>So in brief,
that was a concept from the book that intrigued me.
Still,
after reflecting on it for some time,
the idea that a piece of DNA
has passed &ldquo;intact&rdquo; from mother to mother,
connecting all of humanity,
strikes a special primal chord within me.</p>
<p>Once I go through the book notes again,
I might come back with more thoughts
on the topic of genes.</p>
