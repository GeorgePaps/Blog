      <description>A phrase I &amp;rsquo;ve been pondering on for some time now is &amp;ldquo;walk your walk&amp;rdquo;. I found that keeping this phrase handy is useful for my mentality. In this post I will share my two main interpretations of it.
The first interpretation relates to personal goal setting. The phrase works as a reminder to keep going, to walk the path that you intended to and not give up when you encounter the first obstacle.</description>

      <description>Traces of intelligence. Rating: 6/10
In this book the author attempts to formally approach consciousness and to unravel the mysteries of its emergence. An arguably ambitious goal. Surprisingly, what you come to realize throughout the book, is that to some extend he succeeds. His concept of convoluted, multi-level strange loops seems to offer an interesting leeway towards the origins of consciousness. Maybe not the only available, nor the most effective, but nevertheless a viable one.</description>

      <title>Just Write</title>

      <description>Find a system that makes writing and re-writing effortless. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to post everything you write, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to write consistently.
Why do that in the first place though? Because writing is an effective way of thinking. When writing you embark on a mental journey towards unexplored paths. A journey where you both explore and expand your thoughts. And this is an invaluable process hardly accessible by other means.</description>
