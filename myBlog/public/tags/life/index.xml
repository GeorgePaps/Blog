      <description>A phrase I &amp;rsquo;ve been pondering on for some time now is &amp;ldquo;walk your walk&amp;rdquo;. I found that keeping this phrase handy is useful for my mentality and in this essay I will share my two interpretation of it.
The first interpretation relates to personal goal setting. The phrase works as a reminder to keep going, to walk the path that you intended to and not give up when you encounter the first obstacle.</description>

      <description>Find a system that makes writing and re-writing effortless. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to post everything you write, but it&amp;rsquo;s good to write consistently.
Why do that in the first place though? Because writing is an effective way of thinking. When writing your embark on a mental journey towards unexplored paths. A journey where you both explore and expand your thoughts. And this is an invaluable process hardly accessible by other means.</description>
